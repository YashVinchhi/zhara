    "ai_response": "Sure! Water cycles through several stages during the day:\n\n1. **Evaporation**: The first stage where raindrops on Earth are transformed from liquid to vapor as they fall off a leaf or branch, and then fall back to their original form of water droplets. In this stage, water molecules in the clouds become more mobile due to gravity. \n\n2. **Condensation**: As water droplets evaporate, the water molecules combine with each other to create tiny water molecules that are less dense than the surrounding air and rise into the atmosphere.\n\n3. **Precipitation**: This process occurs when raindrops fall from a cloud or droplet of snow. Water in these drops then condenses into liquid droplets, forming clouds. \n\n4. **Cloud Formation**: The falling droplets, which have gained more water, form small clouds of ice crystals that eventually become precipitation.\n\n5. **Rainfall**: This is the main and most visible stage where raindrops start to fall from the sky. The rain falls through the Earth's surface like a fine mist, forming small puddles on land or in streams that are called rivers. \n\n6. **Gristation**: Rain drops become water droplets when they come together under pressure from gravity.\n\n7. **Falling**: As the water droplets combine with each other and rise up through clouds, it eventually falls back to Earth as raindrops hitting a surface or falling from a cloud on land. This is how we get water in our rivers and streams and oceans.\n\n8. **Rushing Water**: The last stage of the cycle is when the water droplets rush down the Earth's surface or through clouds like a torrent, forming rain or sleet that falls to the ground as snow or ice melt.",
